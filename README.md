# dgPong

gdPong is a small game used to learn Godot. I'm gonna try to finish it in just one weekend from this first commit. 

The project runs in **Godot 3**.

### Features

Basic pong game in 2d, with almost not graphics:

- Sounds
- Collisions
- Player1 controlled by the user
- Player2 controlled by the user 
  or
- Player2 controlled by basic IA

### How to play

Move the left paddle with the keys <kbd>W</kbd>, <kbd>A</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd> and <kbd>D</kbd> (you must click over the game first).

Move the rigth paddle with the arrows.

Press <kbd>Space</kbd> to restart the game and swith between player 2 and IA
